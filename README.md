# Multi-scale multi-object star model
multi-scale multi-object star model Matlab code for single shot object detection & recognition. 
Trained using one or few examples per object, can support up to few thousands of objects at once.
This code is a public implementation of the methods reported in the paper:

L. Karlinsky, J. Shtok, et al. "Fine-grained recognition of thousands of object categories with single-example training", CVPR 2017
